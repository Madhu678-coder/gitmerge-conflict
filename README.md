## Assignment-3;Branching Strategies & Merge Conflicts
## Objective
work with branches an resolving the merge conflicts usinf github flow

## Tasks Completed

1. Created a new GitHub repository and followed **GitHub Flow**:
   - Work on feature branches.
   - Open pull requests early and frequently.
   - Merge only after review/conflict resolution.

2. Created a simple HTML page (`index.html`).
3. Created a simple file('styles.css)

## Branches Created

- **Branch A**: `feature/update-styling`  
  Modified styles in `styles.css`.

- **Branch B**: `feature/add-content`  
  Modified the padding in 'styles.css'.

## Merge Conflict Simulated

- Both branches modified `styles.css` â€” different sections, but same file.
- Merged `feature/update-styling` first.
- Encountered a **merge conflict** while merging `feature/add-content`.

##  Conflict Resolution Steps

1. Switched to conflict branch and pulled updates from `main`:
   git checkout feature/add-content
   git pull origin main

2. Conflict appeared in `styles.css`:

3.The conflict araised due to the changes in padding
4. Manually resolved by combining both:

5. Finalized resolution:
   git add styles.css
   git commit 
   git push origin feature/add-content
